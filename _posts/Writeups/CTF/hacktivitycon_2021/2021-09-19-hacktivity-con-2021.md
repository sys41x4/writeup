## Bass64 [WARMUPS]

![Bass64 Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Bass64/bass64_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`It, uh... looks like someone bass-boosted this? Can you make any sense of it ?`

## Bass64 | [SOLUTION]

Download the challenge File from the attachment button<br>
After oppening it we will be presented with an ASCII ART<br>

![Bass64 ASCII ART](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Bass64/bass64_ascii-art.png)

Here I have used **micro** (A terminal text editor) to open the file.<br>
We can also use **nano**,**sublime text**, or any other text editor we want

After getting the text, we just have to type those in terminal<br>
and we will be presented with a base64 encoded string.<br>
Just decoding it will give us the FLAG for this challenge

![Bass64 FLAG](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Bass64/bass64_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{35a5d13da6a2afa0c62bfcbdd6301a0a}`

## Read The Rules [WARMUPS]

![Read-The-Rules Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Read-the-Rules/read-the-rules_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`Please follow the rules for this CTF`

## Read The Rules | [SOLUTION]

In the Challenge description there will be a link<br>
which is `https://ctf.hacktivitycon.com/rules`

On viewing the source-code of the webpage<br>
we are going to have our flag in HTML comments<br>

![Read-The-Rules Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Read-the-Rules/read-the-rules_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{90bc54705794a62015369fd8e86e557b}`

## 2EZ [WARMUPS]

![2EZ Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/2EZ/2EZ_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`These warmups are just too easy! This one definitely starts that way, at least!`

## 2EZ | [SOLUTION]

Let us first download the provided attachment file<br>
After, downloading it we are going to open it in hexedit<br>

![2EZ Challenge File](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/2EZ/2EZ_challenge_file.png)

There we can see that it is a `JPEG` file.<br>
We can say so by analysing the header bytes<br>
But the first bytes are changed in this case<br>

So we can fix this JPEG file by fixing it's header bytes<br>
The magical header bytes of `jpeg` is `FF D8 FF E0`

![2EZ Solved File](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/2EZ/2EZ_solved_file.png)

So fixing the first 4 bytes of the file with `FF D8 FF E0`<br>
we will be provided with the flag, which is written in the JPEG file.

![2EZ FLAG](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/2EZ/2EZ_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{812a2ca65f334ea1ab234d8af3c64d19}`

## Target Practice [WARMUPS]

![Target Practice Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Target-Practice/Target-Practice_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`Can you hit a moving target?`

`Note, this flag contains only 24 hexadecimal characters.`

## Target Practice | [SOLUTION]

Let us first download the provided attachment file.<br>
We got to see that it is a `GIF` file.

![Target Practice Challenge File](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Target-Practice/target_practice.gif)

While opening it we can see that it is showing some random qr codes like images

I have used strings, hexedit, steghide, exiftool, binwalk but those didn't work.

So I thought to extract all the frames from the GIF file and then analyse it.

So I have used an online <a href="https://extractgif.imageonline.co/index.php">gif-to-png</a> converter tool
and got all the frames from the GIF file in png format.

We got to have 22 png file, which means that there might be 22 frames in the PNG file.

![Target Practice 22 PNG Files](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Target-Practice/Target-Practice_22_png_files.png)

So I thought to do a quick reverse search using **Google Reverse Image Search Tool** `https://www.google.com/imghp`
with the first png image that was extracted from the GIF file

There we got to see that it is referring to `MAXI CODE`

![Target Practice google Reverse Image Search](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Target-Practice/Target_practice_google_rev_search.png)

Then with no time I have searched for the `Maxicode Decoder` and got a website for decoding maxicode images `https://products.aspose.app/barcode/recognize/maxicode#`

There I have started to try all 22 PNGs that I have.

On the 16th PNG we got the flag for this challenge

![Target Practice maxicode flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Target-Practice/Target-Practice_flag_maxicode.png)

![Target Practice maxicode flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Target-Practice/Target-Practice_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{385e3ae5d7b2ca2510be8ef4}`

## Tsunami [WARMUPS]

![Tsunami Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Tsunami/Tsunami_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`Woah! It's a natural disaster! But something doesn't seem so natural about this big wave...`

## Tsunami | [SOLUTION]

So let us download the file.<br>
while analysing the file type with `file` command<br>
we got to see that it is a `WAV` file.

![Tsunami filetype](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Tsunami/Tsunami_filetype.png)

After playing the wav file, I was sure that it's an `Audio Stegnography`

I quickly fireup the `Audacity` and opened the wav file in it.<br>
changed the view from `waveform` to `Spectrogram`

![Tsunami Audacity Analysis](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Tsunami/Tsunami_audacity_analysis.png)

While moving at the very end we got our flag \0/

![Tsunami Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Tsunami/Tsunami_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{f8fbb2c761821d3af23858f721cc140b}`

## Six Four Over Two [WARMUPS]

![Six Four Over Two Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Six-Four-Over-Two/Six-Four-Over-Two_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`I wanted to cover all the bases so I asked my friends what they thought, but they said this challenge was too basic...`

## Six Four Over Two | [SOLUTION]

Let us download the file of the challenge.

After opening the file we got to see that it has some string written in it.<br>
`EBTGYYLHPNQTINLEGRSTOMDCMZRTIMBXGY2DKMJYGVSGIOJRGE2GMOLDGBSWM7IK`<br>

With first glance I have understood that it's a `Base32` encoded string.<br>
Then decoding the `base32` encoded string gives us the flag for this challenge.

![Six Four Over Two Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Six-Four-Over-Two/Six-Four-Over-Two_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{a45d4e70bfc407645185dd9114f9c0ef}`

## Butter Overflow [WARMUPS]

![Butter Overflow Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_details.png)

`Author: @M_alpha#3534`

`Can you overflow this right?`

## Butter Overflow | [SOLUTION]

We will be provided with 3 files as an attachment<br>
But I have used 2 from them which are<br>
`source.c` and `butter_overflow`<br>

`butter_overflow` is an binary file, and `source.c` is it's source File.

As it it a warmup challenge I was sure that a basic buffer overflow will get us the flag.

The `source.c` has a C-code which is

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

void give_flag();

void handler(int sig) {
    if (sig == SIGSEGV)
        give_flag();
}

void give_flag() {
    char *flag = NULL;
    FILE *fp = NULL;
    struct stat sbuf;

    if ((fp = fopen("flag.txt", "r")) == NULL) {
        puts("Could not open flag file.");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    fstat(fileno(fp), &sbuf);

    flag = malloc(sbuf.st_size + 1);
    if (flag == NULL) {
        puts("Failed to allocate memory for the flag.");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    fread(flag, sizeof(char), sbuf.st_size, fp);
    flag[sbuf.st_size] = '\0';

    puts(flag);

    fclose(fp);
    free(flag);

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

int main() {
    char buffer[0x200];

    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
    setbuf(stdin, NULL);

    signal(SIGSEGV, handler);

    puts("How many bytes does it take to overflow this buffer?");
    gets(buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

So what I have done is first I have make the binary executable<br>
using the command `chmod +x butter_overflow`<br>

Then I have analysed it with `checksec` (A tool from pwntools package)

![Butter Overflow checksec analysis](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_checksec.png)

Then I have generated a len 1000 cyclic string and forward it to file named `alphabet`<br>
using the command `cyclic 1000 > alphabet`<br>
Which means `alphabet` is a filename and can be of any name you want, and it contains a string having length 1000.

Let Us now use gdb to analyse the binary.

![Butter Overflow gdb analysis](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_gdb.png)

After passing the strings from the `alphabet` file using<br>
`r < alphabet`<br>
we got to see that a bufferoverflow has occured.

![Butter Overflow pwndbg analysis](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_pwndbg.png)

We got to see that we have a hit at string `faafgaaf`<br>
Finding the string in the `alphabet` file using `grep` give us the exact string<br>
which we require to cause the overflow.

![Butter Overflow grep](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_search_exact_string.png)

There was a `deploy` button at the challenge details<br>
which provide us an ip address and a port to connect with `nc`<br>
On deploying the instance we got to see an input string, which ask us to provide an input.

![Butter Overflow deploy instance](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_nc_connect.png)

Providing the string that causes the buffer-overflow in the program<br>
as an input string provide us the flag for this challenge.

![Butter Overflow Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Butter-Overflow/Butter-Overflow_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{72d8784a5da3a8f56d2106c12dbab989}`

## Pimple [WARMUPS]

![Pimple Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Pimple/pimple_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`This challenge is simple,it's just a pimple!`

## Pimple | [SOLUTION]

Let us first download the file, and check the type of the file.

![Pimple Filetype](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Pimple/pimple_filetype.png)

Here we can see that it is a GIMP file.

Let us open the challenge file `pimple` in GIMP or <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">photopea</a> (alternative GIMP file opener Online)<br>
As I don't have GIMP installed in my system, I am using the online alternative version for it.

![Pimple load Image](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Pimple/pimple_load_image.png)

After removing 6 Top-most layers we got to see out flag.

![Pimple Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Pimple/pimple_flag.png)


`FLAG : flag{9a64bc4a390cb0ce31452820ee562c3f}`

## Confidentiality [WEB]

![Confidentiality Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Confidentiality/Confidentiality_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`My school was trying to teach people about the cIA triad so they made all these dumb example applications... as if they know anything about information security. Can you prove these aren't secure?`

## Confidentiality | [SOLUTION]

Let us start the instance for this challenge.

Then we are provided with a HTTP Address<br>
In this case we are provided with `http://challenge.ctf.games:31265`

On visiting the webapp we will be provided with a basic webpage<br>
where in the input field it was written as `/etc/hosts`

On providing the input as `/etc/hosts` we are provided with a response text<br>
which is similar for listing directory.

![Confidentiality Basic Command](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Confidentiality/Confidentiality_basic-command-input.png)

While getting a proper response, we can also generate an error<br>
so that we can analyse the process in a better way<br>

While providing `aaa` we can get the command `ls -l` that is used to provide us the response.

![Confidentiality Error](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Confidentiality/Confidentiality_error-generating.png)

So I thought of using piping which is `|`<br>
We can also use `;` or `&` to execute two commands at the same time<br>
with which we can generate a one-liner command.

So, First of all I use to list the home directory using the command `/etc/hosts | ls -la /home`<br>
Then, I got the user in the instance, named as `user`<br>
Then I list the `user` home directory using the command `/etc/hosts | ls -la /home/user`<br>
and got to see the files in the user directory.<br>
There we have our flag as `flag.txt`

![Confidentiality List User directory](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Confidentiality/Confidentiality_command-execution.png)

Then I use the `cat` command to get the content of `flag.txt`<br>
providing input as `/etc/hosts | cat /home/user/flag.txt`

![Confidentiality Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Confidentiality/Confidentiality_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{e56abbce7b83d62dac05e59fb1e81c68}`

## Integrity [WEB]

![Integrity Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`My school was trying to teach people about the CIA triad so they made all these dumb example applications... as if they know anything about information security.`<br>
`Supposedly they learned their lesson and tried to make this one more secure. Can you prove it still vulnerable?`

## Integrity | [SOLUTION]

Let us start the instance for this challenge.

Then we are provided with a HTTP Address<br>
In this case we are provided with `http://challenge.ctf.games:30043`

On visiting the webpage we got to see a homepage, where it was written `/etc/hosts` in the input field.

![Integrity Homepage](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_homepage.png)

While providing the input as `/etc/hosts` we got to see that the webapp was returning a SHA256 hash of that file.

![Integrity SHA256 HASH of /etc/hosts](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_basic-input-sha256-hash.png)

After lot of Try-&-Errors I thought of passing the request through burp.<br>
Sorry but I don't have the snap of those errors.<br>

Passing the request through burp provide us the request.

![Integrity first request through burp](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_basic-input-burp-req.png)

Then passing the request to repeater, and with an unusual guess I got Command Injection in the instance.

![Integrity list home Directory](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_list-home-directory.png)

There we got the user as `user`<br>
Then listing the `user` directory provide us the files in that directory<br>
and we got to see the flag for this challenge there as `flag.txt`

![Integrity list user Directory](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_list-user-directory.png)

Then using the `cat` command to print the content of `flag.txt` file provide us the flag fo rthis challenge.

![Integrity Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Integrity/Integrity_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{62b8b3cb5b8c6803bf3dc585b1b5141d}`

## Swaggy [WEB]

![Swaggy Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_details.png)

`Author: @congon4tor#2334`

`This API documentation has all the swag`

## Swaggy | [SOLUTION]

Let us start the instance for this challenge.

Then we are provided with a HTTP Address<br>
In this case we are provided with `http://challenge.ctf.games:32286`

Onn visiting the web address we have been provided with a webapp.

![Swaggy Homepage](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_homepage.png)

Let us change to `staging server for testing` where it was written `Production (Currently Unavailable)`<br>
so that we can now test the webapp.

![Swaggy Testing Server](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_testing-server.png)

We can now click on the `Authorize` Tab to see what it does.<br>
On selecting it we can see a Dialog Box<br>
where we have to enter `username` and `Password`<br>

![Swaggy Authorize Tab](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_basic-auth.png)

As we all know the default testing credentials is `admin : admin`<br>
and we can see that we got it correct. \0/

![Swaggy Authorize Grant](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_basic-auth-access-grant.png)

Then closing the Dialog Box and selecting the `/flag` Tab to see the content in that Tab.

![Swaggy /flag Tab](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_flag-tab-details.png)

Then clicking on `Try it out` button to see what happens next.<br>
On clicking it we can see that another button mentioning `Execute` is shown

![Swaggy /flag Tab Try-it-out](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_flag-tab-tryout.png)

While clicking the `Execute` button we have be presented with a curl command

![Swaggy /flag Tab Execute](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_curl-request.png)

While copying and pasting the provided `curl` command in terminal and executing it<br>
We got to see the Flag for this challenge.

![Swaggy Flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Swaggy/Swaggy_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{e04f962d0529a4289a685112bf1dcdd3}`

## Jed Sheeran [OSINT]

![Jed Sheeran Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Jed-Sheeran/Jed-Sheeran_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`Oh we have another fan with a budding music carrier! Jed Sheeran is seemingly trying to produce new songs based off of his number one favourite artist... but it doesn't all sound so good. Can you find him?`

`Find the flag somewhere in the world wide web with the clues provided.`


## Jed Sheeran | [SOLUTION]

Search For `Jed Sheeran`  in Google Search<br>
We are going to get a link to `soundcloud` at first.

![Jed Sheeran Google Search](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Jed-Sheeran/Jed-Sheeran_google-search.png)

Visiting the link will provide us with `Jed Sheeran` Soundcloud profile.

![Jed Sheeran SoundCloud UA](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Jed-Sheeran/Jed-Sheeran_soundcloud-UA.png)

There will be a song named `Beautiful People`<br>
and opening that song's comment section provide us our flag for this challenge.

![Jed Sheeran flag](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Jed-Sheeran/Jed-Sheeran_flag.png)

`FLAG : flag{59e56590445321ccefb4d91bba61f16c}`

## Mike Shallot [OSINT]

![Mike Shallot Details](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Mike-Shallot/Mike-Shallot_details.png)

`Author: @JohnHammond#6971`

`Mike Shallot is one shady fella. We are aware of him trying to share some specific intel, but hide it amongst the corners and crevices of internet. Can you find his secret?`

`Find the flag somewhere in the world wide web with the clues provided`

## Mike Shallot | [SOLUTION]

While searching the username `mikeshallot` in `twitter`, `reddit`, `facebook`, `instagram` and other sites<br>
We didn't got any valid information about how to proceed further.<br>

But searching in `pastebin` as username we got to see his account there<br>
Which provide some information that makes us sure that it is what we are finding for.

![Mike Shallot pastebin UA](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Mike-Shallot/Mike-Shallot_pastebin-UA.png)

There we see that the account has a note for public access named as `Shallot's Summons`<br>
Opening the note provide some information and 2 strings.

![Mike Shallot pastebin note](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Mike-Shallot/Mike-Shallot_pastebin_note.png)

The contents written there was

```
This site is not as safe as we need it to be. 
Meet me in the dark and I will share my secret with you.
 
Find me in the shadows, these may act as your light:
 
strongerw2ise74v3duebgsvug4mehyhlpa7f6kfwnas7zofs3kov7yd
 
pduplowzp/nndw79
```

So basically there are two strings provided, the first string at line 6<br>
which seems to be an `onion` link.

Using `Google Dorking` to find any valid information about the first random string.<br>
I have used `inurl:strongerw2ise74v3duebgsvug4mehyhlpa7f6kfwnas7zofs3kov7yd intext:strongerw2ise74v3duebgsvug4mehyhlpa7f6kfwnas7zofs3kov7yd` as dorking string<br>

So here it is. It's an onion link.

![Mike Shallot onion link google search](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Mike-Shallot/Mike-Shallot_onion-link-google-search.png)

After visiting the link we are provided with `Stronghold Paste` webapp<br>
Similar to `pastebin`<br>
So it's simply a data pasting field.<br>

Do you remember we have another string at `line 8` in `pastebin` content ?

![Mike Shallot pastebin last string](/assets/CTF/hacktivitycon_2021/Challenges/Mike-Shallot/Mike-Shallot_pastebin-last-string.png)


On pasting the 2nd strings from `line 8` in url as<br>
`https://strongerw2ise74v3duebgsvug4mehyhlpa7f6kfwnas7zofs3kov7yd.onion.ly/pduplowzp/nndw79`<br>

We got to see the Flag for this challenge \0/
