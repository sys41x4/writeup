Dear Visitor, Thank you for visiting my webspace.<br>
I am Arijit Bhowmick, aka `sys41x4`

I'm currently involved in playing CTF's and Pentesting to make a recognition in Infosec Community.
I do also develop CTF Challenges and Open Source projects in my leasure time.
I am currently learning B.Tech Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at <a href='http://sageuniversity.in'>SAGE UNIVERSITY, INDORE, INDIA</a>, and my schooling from <a href='http://chakdahamodelschool.in'>Chakdaha Model School</a>, West Bengal, INDIA.<br>

I'm interested in developing Open-Source softwares, Playing and Making CTF Challenges, Pentesting, reading books and blogging. I overwhelmingly like Python, and try to make it my default programming language as much as possible :)<br>

How can I help you?<br>
I can design, develop, inspect, pentest and deliver technological solutions to your problems.<br>

Do we have something in common? If yes, let's have a talk about it and grow together.<br>
We don't have anything in common?<br>
That's fine, please introduce me something that I'm missing.<br>
