### Challenge Description

![Challenge Details](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/easy-phish/img/challenge_desc.png)

`Customers of secure-startup.com have been recieving some very convincing phishing emails, can you figure out why?`

## SOLUTION

After Visiting the webpage at `secure-statup.com`, it is mentioned to be a parked domain on godaddy.

So, We have to use some osinet tools to gather information about this domain.

I have used `host`, `dig`, `nslookup` and some other tools.

To get the flag, I have used the command

```console
dig TXT secure-startup.com _dmarc.secure-startup.com
```

This is how, I solved this challenge.
