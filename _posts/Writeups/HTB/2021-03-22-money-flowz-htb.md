### Challenge Description

![Challenge Details](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/challenge_desc.png)

`Frank Vitalik is a hustler, can you figure out where the money flows?`

## SOLUTION

We got a name `Frank Vitalik` from the challenge description.

I have used `Google Dorking`, To search his details (profile, discussion, and mentioned name).<br>
The query I have used is

```text
intext:Frank Vitalik site:facebook.com OR site: reddit.com OR site:twitter.com OR site:instagram.com OR site:linkedin.com
```

## Depth Search

1. From the First two links, we get into two reddit conversation.<br>
In the first one it is mentioned about `ETH crypto scam` and a link.

![reddit_conv_1](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/reddit_discussion_1.png)

We get a conversation in the given address about a scam.

2. On the second link of the google dorking, we get into another reddit conversation,<br>
with another `link` in it.

![reddit_conv_2](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/reddit_discussion_2.png)

Which lead us into a webpage mentioning `Super Ethereum SCAM Giveaway` and a `ETH address`<br>
In the comment it is mentioned about `ropsten`.

While searching for `ropsten` in google search.

![ropsten_google_search](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/ropsten_google_search.png)

The first link goes for `https://ropsten.etherscan.io`.<br>
After opening the link I have searched for the ETH address `0x1b3247Cd0A59ac8B37A922804D150556dB837699`<br>

![ropsten_addr_transaction_list](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/ropsten_addr_transaction_list.png)

We have to deal with outbound transactions.

While searching for the outbound transactions in the list.<br>
The oldest outbound transaction I found was `0xe1320c23f292e52090e423e5cdb7b4b10d3c70a8d1b947dff25ae892609f2ef4`

![transaction_addr](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/transaction_addr.png)

We got the details of the transactions and a comment in it, while clicking on the transaction address.

![transaction_comment](/assets/htb/challenge/osint/money-flowz/img/transaction_comment.png)

Click on the `View input as` and click on `UTF-8`.
