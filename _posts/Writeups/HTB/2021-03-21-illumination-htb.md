### Challenge Description

![Challenge Details](/assets/htb/challenge/forensics/illumination/img/challenge_desc.png)


`A Junior Developer just switched to a new source control platform. Can you find the secret token?`

## SOLUTION

Download the zip file provide by the challenge.<br>
The Password for the zip file would be `hackthebox`.

First of all unzip the files from zip file using the command `unzip Illumination.zip`

![Unzip_Files](/assets/htb/challenge/forensics/illumination/img/unzip_compressed_file.png)

Then `cd` into `Illumination.JS` directory as `cd Illumination.JS` and list the files in the directory as  `ls -la`

![list_files](/assets/htb/challenge/forensics/illumination/img/list_files.png)

Here, it can be seen that the directory contain `.git` folder, which seems that it is a git repository.

Then using the command `git log`, we can view the commit details.

Using `git show 335d6cfe3cdc25b89cae81c50ffb957b86bf5a4a` we can view the, **log message and textual diff** of that commit.

Here we can see the `token` is shown at the end of the file.<br>

Let us decode the `base64` encoding of the `token` value.
